A very simple DApp which returns THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS on a GIVEN BLOCK. Please note that it's not a smart-contract centred project because it just needs a simple contract with a constructor and nothing more. It was primarily made to get used to web3js usage and methods and also the working of entire DApp. 

The frontend was made using React JS while the contract was deployed on local Ganache Test Blockchain. Truffle was used for the development purpose and web3js library was used to communicate with the blockchain. Primarily, this little project helped me to understand how different components of a DApp communicate and exchange data between each other. 

Note while cloning: 

As the app is not packaged and built, you can clone the repo and run it in development mode. Also note that after cloning, users will have to execute the following command in the project folder : "npm run" to install the required node modules in the package.json file. 

Thanks!
